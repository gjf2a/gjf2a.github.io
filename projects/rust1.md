worktitle: Creating Shell Commands Using Rust
---

Implement the following shell commands as Rust programs. 
You might find the [fs crate](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/index.html) useful in 
writing many of these programs:

* `dir`: Prints out all of the names of the files and directories in the current directory. It will not employ any command-line arguments.
* `destroy`: Delete every file in the list of command-line arguments.
* `newname`: This program expects two command-line arguments. It will give a "usage" message if it does not receive them. It will change the name of the file given by the first argument to be the name given by the second argument.
* `duplicate`: This program also expects two command-line arguments. It will give a "usage" message if it does not receive them. It will make a copy of the file given by the first argument with the name given by the second argument.
* `start`: Prints out the first ten lines of each file listed in the command-line arguments. If the first argument begins with a dash, use the number immediately following the dash instead of ten.
* `counter`: Prints out the number of words, lines, and characters for each file listed in its command-line arguments. If the first argument begins with a dash, the letters "w", "l", and "c" immediately following the dash indicate which of words, lines, and characters get displayed.

## Submissions
* Create a separate **private** GitHub repository for each of these programs.
* [Submit GitHub URLs](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0I-c_DBBX5N-V36PPuwAHnijoj4LlKNsTP5SCWjg60dNMKQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

## Assessment
* **Partial**: Any three programs correctly completed.
* **Complete**: All six programs correctly completed.
