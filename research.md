## Research Statement

My research activity falls into two broad categories:
* **Robotics and Artificial Intelligence**: The central research question I have explored in robotics is: "How can robots be made easier to program?" To that end, I study varying approaches to machine learning, subsumptive control, and AI planning. I employ inexpensive robots, so studying approaches that are practical on such platforms is an essential aspect of my robotics research. I am also strongly interested in robotics education.
* **Computer Science Education**: My educational research goals include teaching students how to write reliable software and building software tools to assist student learning:
  * [Pluggable Interrupt OS](https://github.com/gjf2a/pluggable_interrupt_os): The Pluggable Interrupt OS enables students to quickly and easily build bare-metal kernels using the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language. I employ this tool in my [Operating Systems](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci320/) course.
  * [Grambler](https://github.com/gjf2a/grambler): Grambler is a parser generator that uses the Earley algorithm. I find most parser generators require excessive effort to explain to students. For student projects, clarity and ease of use are more important than parsing efficiency. Building a parser generator on the Earley algorithm enables it to accept all context-free grammars, greatly easing the teaching of parsing.
  * [Boundalyzer](https://github.com/gjf2a/boundalyzer): Boundalyzer is a software modeling and specification tool I developed when teaching the Black Box concept from [Cleanroom Software Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/Cleanroom-Software-Engineering-Technology-Process/dp/B000REU39C/ref=sr_1_1?crid=34RP6LQST41QO&keywords=cleanroom+software+engineering+technology+and+process&qid=1662346689&s=books&sprefix=cleanroom+software+engineering+technology+and+process%2Cstripbooks%2C124&sr=1-1). It enables students to write specifications of the boundary between a software artifact and its environment. It will automatically check these specifications for completeness and consistency, reporting any problems to the student.
